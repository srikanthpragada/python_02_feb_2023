Art for All is inspired by the true story of a young
girl in Egypt who noticed that the refugees in her
community sometimes had difficulty in adjusting
to their new home. She wanted everyone to feel
welcome and to have the chance to be happy!
Determined to take action, she used her love of art
to help the refugees integrate into the community.
This childrenâ€™s picture book is the result of a
collaboration between Ashoka and Worldreader. It
is intended to inspire children everywhere to
become Changemakers and encourage adults
everywhere to support them in their journey.
